# Mobile Joystick Movement with the New Input System
In this tutorial repository you can learn how to add a Touch Movement Joystick to control your player using the New Input System. 
We'll specifically look at how to do that with a `NavMeshAgent`, but the same concept can be applied to `Rigidbody` movement or a `CharacterController`. In this tutorial you'll learn the full end to end process of Joystick Creation, Canvas Setup, & Code, along with some of the "gotchas" I learned when implementing my own mobile game so you don't have to run into the same struggles!

The Enhanced Touch API raises events `onFingerDown`, `onFingerMove`, and `onFingerUp` events to us when the user touches, moves, or lets go of the screen. It keeps track of which finger is doing what, so we can track each finger separately.
